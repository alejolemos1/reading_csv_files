# Reading csv files
In this project, I have read a CSV file that contains data about countries, such as population, continent, capital, etc. Using matplotlib, the csv module, and their functions, I was able to read the information I need to create charts, such as the 2022 population of South American countries in a pie chart, or the population by year in Argentina in a bar chart.
